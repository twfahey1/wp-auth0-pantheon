# wp-auth0-pantheon Plugin
This plugin demonstrates how to properly set the Auth0 cookie for usage on Pantheon. The ability to modify the cookie was brought up in this issue: https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/issues/494, and ultimately resolved in this PR: https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/pull/495.

This plugin can be enabled and used as is, or the code adopted for use in any other plugin / theme, etc.
